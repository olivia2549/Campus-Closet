# Campus-Closet

Our project is a sustainability app for Vanderbilt Fashion Week for users to buy and sell reused clothes. To ensure user safety, students must sign in and verify their Vanderbilt email account in order to access its full features. This app is released on the App Store, but will not be marketed to students until the Spring semester after completing performance improvements and bug fixes.

Use cases for all users include: 
1. direct messaging to discuss pickup location and payment details
2. creating and viewing profiles

Use cases for buyers include:
1. finding affordable, reused items from other students at the same campus
2. placing a bid or saving an item for later viewing from their profile
3. leaving a rating for the seller to inform other buyers
4. learning about the sustainable impact they can have by buying reused items

Use cases for sellers include:
1. posting an item for sale
2. accepting offers on their listings

Our implementation uses SwiftUI with Firebase.
